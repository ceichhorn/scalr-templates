This can be used to create a scalr farm with lots of haproxy's.

1 create your farm with at least 1 haproxy.

It's a good idea to make sure your haproxy is last on the list.

Once created save your farm and create a farm template.

Download the farm template you created.  I just copied and pasted it into a vi window.
Save the file as farm-template.json, make a backupjust in case.

On the bottom of the file you should see the haproxy farm role settings.

Remove the last 2 lines of the file and add a comma to the last bracket.

-----------------
"storage": []
        }
    ]
}

Changes to:

"storage": []
        },

-------------------

Run the create-farm.sh script and it will copy in haproxy farm roles for each property needed.

When done your farm template just needs to be edited so the last lines look like what it was.  
Meaning remove the last comma and add back the 2 brackets as above.
